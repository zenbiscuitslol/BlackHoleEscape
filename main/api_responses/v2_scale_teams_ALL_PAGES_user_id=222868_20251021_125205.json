His understanding of the project was crystal clear; he could explain every part of it in detail and with confidence. The final result worked perfectly, smooth performance and no visible issues at all. It’s rare to see that level of technical skill combined with such solid presentation.",

Take the time to discuss\nand debate the problems you have identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some difference in how your\npeers might have understood the project's instructions and the\nscope of its functionalities.

Ensure that the work is for the relevant project\n and also check that \"git clone\" is used in an empty folder.\n\n - Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you\n and make you evaluate something other than the content of the\n official repository.\n\n - To avoid any surprises, carefully check that both the evaluating\n and the evaluated students have reviewed the possible scripts used\n to facilitate the grading.\n\n - If the evaluating student has not completed that particular\n project yet, it is mandatory for this student to read the\n entire subject prior to starting the defence.\n\n - Use the flags available on this scale to signal an empty repository,\n non-functioning program, a norm error, cheating etc. In these cases,\n the grading is over and the final grade is 0 (or -42 in case of\n cheating). However, with the exception of cheating, you are\n encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not\n finished it) in order to identify any issues that may have caused\n this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.\n \n - Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault,\n no other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected\n termination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the\n appropriate flag. \n You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it exists.\n If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons with the \n evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n - You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on the heap must\n be properly freed before the end of execution.\n You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such as\n leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the appropriate flag.\n",

Like in *philo*, he always keeps working on improvements, even from the start. His program didn’t exit immediately when a philosopher died; it continued processing the remaining actions like eating or sleeping until completion, but he managed to fix that properly. I also noticed his Makefile uses `gcc` instead of `cc`. I know that’s a Norm issue, but I didn’t want to fail him or make it look like I was doing it on purpose. Overall, as I said, he knows exactly what needs to be done for this project.\r\n",

Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. The pedagogy is effective only if peer evaluation is conducted seriously.\n",

        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s).\n  Confirm that it contains the expected project and that it has been cloned\n  into an empty directory.\n\n- Ensure that no malicious aliases have been used to mislead you into \n  evaluating content outside of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report issues such as an empty repository,\n  non-functioning programs, Norm errors, or suspected cheating.\n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except in cases of cheating, students\n  are strongly encouraged to review the submitted work together to identify\n  mistakes that should not be repeated in the future.\n\n- During the defense, ensure there are no segmentation faults or other unexpected,\n  premature, or uncontrolled terminations of the program, else the final \n  grade is 0. Use the appropriate flag if necessary. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to clearly explain the \n  reasons to the evaluated student and ensure that both of you agree with the changes.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

Once you get familiar with this kind of project, everything starts to feel easier and more natural. The logic, the structure, even the debugging flow begin to make sense. Believe me, all the effort you put in now will pay off later, because you’ll definitely use these concepts again in your future projects—they’re the real foundation for what comes next.",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n\n- Identify the possible dysfunctions in the project of the student or\n  group whose work is being evaluated. Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. Pedagogy is useful only if peer evaluation is done seriously.\n",

        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work submitted in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student or students. Ensure that \n  the project is the expected one. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty directory.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to deceive you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises, and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate grading, such as testing or automation scripts.\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you\n  must read the entire subject before starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, etc.\n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends, and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in the case of cheating. However, except in cases of cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review the submitted work together \n  to identify any mistakes that should not be repeated in the future.\n\n- You must also verify that there are no memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the program's execution ends.\n  You are allowed to use any of the tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

Thank you for letting me fix falsely accepting empty input into the PhoneBook. We had a nice and friendly conversation about the project, used concepts and our understanding of them. It was very insightful to also take a look at your code and to see another approach, since C++ is a first for me. Thanks again and good luck for your projects and see you around!",

Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. The pedagogy is effective only if peer evaluation is conducted seriously.\n",
        "disclaimer_md": "",
        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s).\n  Confirm that it contains the expected project and that it has been cloned\n  into an empty directory.\n\n- Ensure that no malicious aliases have been used to mislead you into \n  evaluating content outside of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report issues such as an empty repository,\n  non-functioning programs, Norm errors, or suspected cheating.\n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except in cases of cheating, students\n  are strongly encouraged to review the submitted work together to identify\n  mistakes that should not be repeated in the future.\n\n- During the defense, ensure there are no segmentation faults or other unexpected,\n  premature, or uncontrolled terminations of the program, else the final \n  grade is 0. Use the appropriate flag if necessary. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to clearly explain the \n  reasons to the evaluated student and ensure that both of you agree with the changes.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n\n- Identify with the student or group whose work is evaluated the possible \n  dysfunctions in their project. Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. The pedagogy is useful only and only if the peer-evaluation is \n  done seriously.\n",

        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, student are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \n  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. Peer evaluation is only effective if taken seriously.\n",

Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to deceive you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the appropriate flags to report an empty repository, a malfunctioning\n  program, a Norm error, or cases of cheating.\n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, student are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- During the defense, no segmentation faults or any other unexpected, premature,\n  or uncontrolled terminations are allowed. Otherwise, the final grade will be 0.\n  Use the appropriate flag. \n  You should never need to modify any file except the configuration file, if one exists.\n  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explain the reasons to the\n  evaluated student and ensure both of you agree.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on the heap must\n  be properly freed before the end of execution.\n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such as\n  leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the appropriate flag.\n",

Listen to your discussion partner's\n  perspective with an open mind (are they right or wrong ?) and grade them as\n  fairly as possible.\n  42's teaching methods can make sense only if peer-evaluation is\n  taken seriously.\n",

However, if it's\n  not a cheating problem, you are invited to keep talking about the work that\n  has been done (or not done, as a matter of fact) in order to identify the\n  issues that lead to this stalemate and avoid it next time.\n",

He clearly understands how the project is supposed to be approached and how to organize the different requirements in order to reach a working solution. The logic for handling the map input and rendering the structure is implemented in a way that demonstrates real comprehension of the subject’s core ideas. However, there is still a visible limitation: at the moment the code only manages a single space correctly and does not properly deal with additional spacing or irregular spacing in the input. Another point that stands out is the missing support for the color codes. According to the subject, maps may contain optional hexadecimal color values (for example ,0xFFFFFF), and this part of the specification has not been implemented in his solution. I also checked the subject text again and it is true that it can be a bit confusing, since color support is mentioned but not emphasized as a mandatory requirement in every case. In practice, though, evaluators usually expect the project to handle it. Despite these missing features, the result still fulfills the main requirements and shows the project can be finished",

And I agree to the points that you have mentioned, and I will definitely update the code based on your feedback and ideas. Thankyou for the same. And good luck with your projects.",

And I agree to the points that you have mentioned, and I will definitely update the code based on your feedback and ideas. Thankyou for the same. And good luck with your projects.",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n\n- Identify with the student or group whose work is evaluated the possible \n  dysfunctions in their project. Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. Pedagogy is only useful if the peer evaluation is conducted seriously.\n",

Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that \"git clone\" is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any issues, and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  for grading facilitation (e.g., testing or automation scripts).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject before starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends, and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review the submitted work together to identify\n  mistakes that should not be repeated in the future.\n",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n\n- Work with the student or group whose project is being evaluated to\n  identify possible issues. Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. Peer evaluation is only effective if taken seriously.\n",

Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to deceive you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the appropriate flags to report an empty repository, a malfunctioning\n  program, a Norm error, or cases of cheating.\n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, student are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- During the defense, no segmentation faults or any other unexpected, premature,\n  or uncontrolled terminations are allowed. Otherwise, the final grade will be 0.\n  Use the appropriate flag. \n  You should never need to modify any file except the configuration file, if one exists.\n  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explain the reasons to the\n  evaluated student and ensure both of you agree.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on the heap must\n  be properly freed before the end of execution.\n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such as\n  leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the appropriate flag.\n",

Take the time to discuss\n  and debate any problems you may have identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your\n  peers might have understood the project's instructions and the\n  scope of its functionalities.

However, except for cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to discuss the work that was turned in together, \n  in order to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the \n  future.\n",

In my opinion, thats not the right way to conduct an evaluation. It comes across as disrespectful to the effort we put into the project and also a bit lazy.\r\n\r\nAfter that, we did try to fix the mistakes you pointed out, but given the size of the project, we werent able to find the solution before you moved on to the next evaluation.

It felt like you werent really interested in our project itself. I made sure to let you know that I wasnt okay with you just relying on a tester to find cases where our Minishell breaks. In my opinion, thats not the right way to conduct an evaluation. It comes across as disrespectful to the effort we put into the project and also a bit lazy.\r\n\r\nAfter that, we did try to fix the mistakes you pointed out, but given the size of the project, we werent able to find the solution before you moved on to the next evaluation. Maybe take this as a push to think about the way you approach evaluations in the future.",

For smaller projects, it is usually recommended to separate the bonus part from the mandatory one, but for this project it is acceptable that you did not. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend learning how to add modularized solutions or features by reusing existing code — this is exactly why the subject requires the bonus part to be separated.\r\n\r\nYour Minishell is very well implemented and shows Bash-like behavior. For example, after unsetting PATH and running cd /bin/, the shell was still able to find the commands located in /bin. However, as you demonstrated, your Minishell requires a PATH variable to function correctly, so adding it again with export PATH=/bin/ solved the issue. Another test we performed was echo \"X\"$HOME'x'. Here, we had to insert a space between each argument, after which it worked exactly like in Bash.\r\n\r\nOverall, the shell is very close to Bash behavior, while still not being Bash itself — which is perfectly fine and expected. Congratulations on passing your first Minishell evaluation, and I wish you the best of luck for the upcoming ones! ",

Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. Peer evaluation is only effective if taken seriously.\n",

Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to deceive you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the appropriate flags to report an empty repository, a malfunctioning\n  program, a Norm error, or cases of cheating.\n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, student are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- During the defense, no segmentation faults or any other unexpected, premature,\n  or uncontrolled terminations are allowed. Otherwise, the final grade will be 0.\n  Use the appropriate flag. \n  You should never need to modify any file except the configuration file, if one exists.\n  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explain the reasons to the\n  evaluated student and ensure both of you agree.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on the heap must\n  be properly freed before the end of execution.\n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such as\n  leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the appropriate flag.\n",

Right now you have several similar functions that can actually be merged into one, instead of repeating almost the same logic. By unifying them, your code will be cleaner, easier to maintain, and shorter. Also, instead of calling write directly in every function, you can just call a helper function like ft_putchar or similar. That way, if you ever need to change the implementation, you only need to adjust it in one place",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n\n- Identify the possible dysfunctions in the project of the student or\n  group whose work is being evaluated. Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. Pedagogy is useful only if peer evaluation is done seriously.\n",

        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work submitted in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student or students. Ensure that \n  the project is the expected one. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty directory.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to deceive you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises, and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate grading (such as testing or automation scripts).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you\n  must read the entire subject before starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, etc.\n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends, and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in the case of cheating. However, except in cases of cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review the submitted work together \n  to identify any mistakes that should not be repeated in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault, no other \n  unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected termination of the \n  program, else the final grade is 0. Use the appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \n  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify that there are no memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the program's execution ends.\n  You are allowed to use any of the tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n\n- Identify with the student or group whose work is evaluated the possible \n  dysfunctions in their project. Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. The pedagogy is useful only and only if the peer-evaluation is \n  done seriously.\n",
        "disclaimer_md": "",
        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defense, no segfault,no premature or \n  uncontrolled termination of the program; otherwise, the final grade is 0.\n  Use the appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \n  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must verify the absence of data races. \n  You are allowed to use any of the available tools on the computer, such as \n  Valgrind with '--tool=helgrind' and '--tool=drd'.  In case of any \n  data-race, the evaluation stops here.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. You are \n  allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such \n  as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

However, except for cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defense, no segfault,no premature or \n  uncontrolled termination of the program; otherwise, the final grade is 0.\n  Use the appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists.

I don't really know where the problem comes from and since it seems to work some times I don't want to let you fail for this.\r\nAlso there's been an other test case which was shown to us by an other peer which also failed but apparently no one handles this case ???.\r\nOverall you did a great job, good luck and keep grinding :D",

However, except for cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defense, no segfault,no premature or \n  uncontrolled termination of the program; otherwise, the final grade is 0.\n  Use the appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \n  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must verify the absence of data races. \n  You are allowed to use any of the available tools on the computer, such as \n  Valgrind with '--tool=helgrind' and '--tool=drd'.  In case of any \n  data-race, the evaluation stops here.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. You are \n  allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such \n  as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

      "comment": "he miniRT project they worked on is honestly really impressive. From the very start, the way they explained what the project is about and how it works shows that they have a deep understanding of the concept, not just the surface. They didn’t just throw some code together, they actually broke things down step by step, showing how to handle the project in a clear and simple way. That kind of explanation makes it much easier for anyone else to follow along, even if you’re not super experienced with graphics or ray tracing.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, the way the code is written feels really clean and organized. You can see that they paid attention to details, kept the structure readable, and made sure everything runs smoothly without unnecessary complications. It’s the kind of code you can read without getting lost, which is always a big plus. The best part is that the project doesn’t just work—it works well, and you can tell they tested and polished it so the results look solid.\r\n\r\nOverall, the project reflects a lot of effort, creativity, and real problem-solving skills. It’s not only functional but also shows a clear thought process and discipline in coding. You can clearly see how much time and energy was put into making it all come together.",

However, except for cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defense, no segfault,no premature or \n  uncontrolled termination of the program; otherwise, the final grade is 0.\n  Use the appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \n  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must verify the absence of data races. \n  You are allowed to use any of the available tools on the computer, such as \n  Valgrind with '--tool=helgrind' and '--tool=drd'.  In case of any \n  data-race, the evaluation stops here.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. You are \n  allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such \n  as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n\n- Work with the student or group whose project is being evaluated to\n  identify possible issues. Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. Peer evaluation is only effective if taken seriously.\n",

        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Verify that the Git repository belongs to the student(s) and that it\n  contains the correct project. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to deceive you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the appropriate flags to report an empty repository, a malfunctioning\n  program, a Norm error, or cases of cheating.\n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, student are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- During the defense, no segmentation faults or any other unexpected, premature,\n  or uncontrolled terminations are allowed. Otherwise, the final grade will be 0.\n  Use the appropriate flag. \n  You should never need to modify any file except the configuration file, if one exists.\n  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explain the reasons to the\n  evaluated student and ensure both of you agree.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on the heap must\n  be properly freed before the end of execution.\n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such as\n  leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the appropriate flag.\n",

However, except in cases of cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review the submitted work together \n  to identify any mistakes that should not be repeated in the future.\n\n- You must also verify that there are no memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the program's execution ends.\n  You are allowed to use any of the tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence.

However, except for cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defense, no segfault,no premature or \n  uncontrolled termination of the program; otherwise, the final grade is 0.\n  Use the appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \n  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must verify the absence of data races. \n  You are allowed to use any of the available tools on the computer, such as \n  Valgrind with '--tool=helgrind' and '--tool=drd'.  In case of any \n  data-race, the evaluation stops here.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. You are \n  allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such \n  as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. Peer evaluation is only effective if taken seriously.\n",

Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to deceive you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the appropriate flags to report an empty repository, a malfunctioning\n  program, a Norm error, or cases of cheating.\n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, student are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- During the defense, no segmentation faults or any other unexpected, premature,\n  or uncontrolled terminations are allowed. Otherwise, the final grade will be 0.\n  Use the appropriate flag. \n  You should never need to modify any file except the configuration file, if one exists.\n  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explain the reasons to the\n  evaluated student and ensure both of you agree.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on the heap must\n  be properly freed before the end of execution.\n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such as\n  leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n\n- Identify with the student or group whose work is evaluated the possible \n  dysfunctions in their project. Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. The pedagogy is useful only and only if the peer-evaluation is \n  done seriously.\n",
        "disclaimer_md": "",
        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defense, no segfault,no premature or \n  uncontrolled termination of the program; otherwise, the final grade is 0.\n  Use the appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \n  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must verify the absence of data races. \n  You are allowed to use any of the available tools on the computer, such as \n  Valgrind with '--tool=helgrind' and '--tool=drd'.  In case of any \n  data-race, the evaluation stops here.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. You are \n  allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such \n  as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n\n- Identify with the student or group whose work is evaluated the possible \n  dysfunctions in their project. Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. The pedagogy is useful only and only if the peer-evaluation is \n  done seriously.\n",

        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, student are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \n  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n- Constructive feedback helps your peers improve. The well-being of \n  the community depends on a supportive approach.\n\n2. **Identify and Discuss Issues**\n- Work with the student or group to identify potential issues in their project.\n  Take the time to discuss and debate any problems you find.\n\n3. **Acknowledge Different Approaches**\n- Recognize that different students may have different interpretations of the\n  project’s instructions and requirements.\n- Keep an open mind and grade as honestly and fairly as possible.\n- The effectiveness of peer evaluation depends on serious and thoughtful assessment.\n\n4. **Handling Incorrect Exercises**\n- If you encounter an incorrect exercise, stop the assessment immediately.\n- Do not proceed to the next exercise if a previous one is incorrect.\n- Use the appropriate flags to report the issue and provide feedback to the student.\n",
        "disclaimer_md": "",
        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- Do not blindly trust any scripts. The tester could be wrong!\n\n- Check the makefile: no wildcard, no relink, or the final grade is 0.\n\n- Use make, then make --debug to be sure.\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \n  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n\n- Identify with the student or group whose work is evaluated the possible \n  dysfunctions in their project. Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. The pedagogy is useful only and only if the peer-evaluation is \n  done seriously.\n",
        "disclaimer_md": "",
        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defense, no segfault,no premature or \n  uncontrolled termination of the program; otherwise, the final grade is 0.\n  Use the appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \n  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must verify the absence of data races. \n  You are allowed to use any of the available tools on the computer, such as \n  Valgrind with '--tool=helgrind' and '--tool=drd'.  In case of any \n  data-race, the evaluation stops here.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. You are \n  allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such \n  as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, student are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \n  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence.

Your Linux setup using Debian was really solid, handling the installation, partitioning, and configurations like a pro to make everything stable and secure. The WordPress part was strong too, with good testing and the right permissions that showed your effort and made it run smoothly. For the free choice, you picked an FTP server which is a cool idea, but sadly it didn't work properly during the eval—no worries, it's a good chance to learn by checking configs or logs next time. Keep up the awesome work; you're doing great! 😊",

The community's well-being relies on this.\n\n- Work with the student or group to identify potential issues in their project.\n  Take the time to discuss and debate any problems that may arise.\n\n- Keep in mind that your peers may have interpreted the project's instructions\n  and scope differently. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. The pedagogy is effective only if peer evaluation is conducted seriously.\n",

        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s).\n  Confirm that it contains the expected project and that it has been cloned\n  into an empty directory.\n\n- Ensure that no malicious aliases have been used to mislead you into \n  evaluating content outside of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report issues such as an empty repository,\n  non-functioning programs, Norm errors, or suspected cheating.\n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except in cases of cheating, students\n  are strongly encouraged to review the submitted work together to identify\n  mistakes that should not be repeated in the future.\n\n- During the defense, ensure there are no segmentation faults or other unexpected,\n  premature, or uncontrolled terminations of the program, else the final \n  grade is 0. Use the appropriate flag if necessary. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to clearly explain the \n  reasons to the evaluated student and ensure that both of you agree with the changes.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

The community's well-being relies on this.\n\n- Work with the student or group to identify potential issues in their project.\n  Take the time to discuss and debate any problems that may arise.\n\n- Keep in mind that your peers may have interpreted the project's instructions\n  and scope differently. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. The pedagogy is effective only if peer evaluation is conducted seriously.\n",

        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s).\n  Confirm that it contains the expected project and that it has been cloned\n  into an empty directory.\n\n- Ensure that no malicious aliases have been used to mislead you into \n  evaluating content outside of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report issues such as an empty repository,\n  non-functioning programs, Norm errors, or suspected cheating.\n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except in cases of cheating, students\n  are strongly encouraged to review the submitted work together to identify\n  mistakes that should not be repeated in the future.\n\n- During the defense, ensure there are no segmentation faults or other unexpected,\n  premature, or uncontrolled terminations of the program, else the final \n  grade is 0. Use the appropriate flag if necessary. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to clearly explain the \n  reasons to the evaluated student and ensure that both of you agree with the changes.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

However, except in cases of cheating, students\n  are strongly encouraged to review the submitted work together to identify\n  mistakes that should not be repeated in the future.\n\n- During the defense, ensure there are no segmentation faults or other unexpected,\n  premature, or uncontrolled terminations of the program, else the final \n  grade is 0. Use the appropriate flag if necessary. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to clearly explain the \n  reasons to the evaluated student and ensure that both of you agree with the changes.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n\n- Identify with the student or group whose work is evaluated the possible \n  dysfunctions in their project. Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. The pedagogy is useful only if the peer-evaluation is \n  conducted seriously.\n",
        "disclaimer_md": "",
        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Ensure that no malicious aliases were used to deceive you into\n  evaluating content that is not part of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends, and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in the case of cheating. However, except for cases of cheating,\n  students are strongly encouraged to review the submitted work together\n  to identify mistakes that should be avoided in the future.\n\n- During the defense, the program must not produce any segmentation faults,\n  unexpected crashes, or uncontrolled terminations; otherwise, the final grade\n  will be 0. Use the appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you need to edit a file, clearly explain the reason to the\n  evaluated student and ensure that both of you agree on the modification.\n\n- You must also ensure that there are no memory leaks. Any memory allocated on\n  the heap must be properly freed before the program terminates. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n\n- Identify with the student or group whose work is evaluated the possible \n  dysfunctions in their project. Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. The pedagogy is useful only if the peer-evaluation is \n  conducted seriously.\n",

        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Ensure that no malicious aliases were used to deceive you into\n  evaluating content that is not part of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends, and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in the case of cheating. However, except for cases of cheating,\n  students are strongly encouraged to review the submitted work together\n  to identify mistakes that should be avoided in the future.\n\n- During the defense, the program must not produce any segmentation faults,\n  unexpected crashes, or uncontrolled terminations; otherwise, the final grade\n  will be 0. Use the appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you need to edit a file, clearly explain the reason to the\n  evaluated student and ensure that both of you agree on the modification.\n\n- You must also ensure that there are no memory leaks. Any memory allocated on\n  the heap must be properly freed before the program terminates. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n\n- Identify with the student or group whose work is evaluated the possible \n  dysfunctions in their project. Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. The pedagogy is useful only if the peer-evaluation is \n  conducted seriously.\n",

        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Ensure that no malicious aliases were used to deceive you into\n  evaluating content that is not part of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends, and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in the case of cheating. However, except for cases of cheating,\n  students are strongly encouraged to review the submitted work together\n  to identify mistakes that should be avoided in the future.\n\n- During the defense, the program must not produce any segmentation faults,\n  unexpected crashes, or uncontrolled terminations; otherwise, the final grade\n  will be 0. Use the appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you need to edit a file, clearly explain the reason to the\n  evaluated student and ensure that both of you agree on the modification.\n\n- You must also ensure that there are no memory leaks. Any memory allocated on\n  the heap must be properly freed before the program terminates. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence.

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n- Constructive feedback helps your peers improve. The well-being of \n  the community depends on a supportive approach.\n\n2. **Identify and Discuss Issues**\n- Work with the student or group to identify potential issues in their project.\n  Take the time to discuss and debate any problems you find.\n\n3. **Acknowledge Different Approaches**\n- Recognize that different students may have different interpretations of the\n  project’s instructions and requirements.\n- Keep an open mind and grade as honestly and fairly as possible.\n- The effectiveness of peer evaluation depends on serious and thoughtful assessment.\n\n4. **Handling Incorrect Exercises**\n- If you encounter an incorrect exercise, stop the assessment immediately.\n- Do not proceed to the next exercise if a previous one is incorrect.\n- Use the appropriate flags to report the issue and provide feedback to the student.\n",
        "disclaimer_md": "",
        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- Do not blindly trust any scripts. The tester could be wrong!\n\n- Check the makefile: no wildcard, no relink, or the final grade is 0.\n\n- Use make, then make --debug to be sure.\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \n  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n- Constructive feedback helps your peers improve. The well-being of \n  the community depends on a supportive approach.\n\n2. **Identify and Discuss Issues**\n- Work with the student or group to identify potential issues in their project.\n  Take the time to discuss and debate any problems you find.\n\n3. **Acknowledge Different Approaches**\n- Recognize that different students may have different interpretations of the\n  project’s instructions and requirements.\n- Keep an open mind and grade as honestly and fairly as possible.\n- The effectiveness of peer evaluation depends on serious and thoughtful assessment.\n\n4. **Handling Incorrect Exercises**\n- If you encounter an incorrect exercise, stop the assessment immediately.\n- Do not proceed to the next exercise if a previous one is incorrect.\n- Use the appropriate flags to report the issue and provide feedback to the student.\n",
        "disclaimer_md": "",
        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- Do not blindly trust any scripts. The tester could be wrong!\n\n- Check the makefile: no wildcard, no relink, or the final grade is 0.\n\n- Use make, then make --debug to be sure.\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \n  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n\n- Identify with the student or group whose work is evaluated the possible \n  dysfunctions in their project. Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. Pedagogy is only useful if the peer evaluation is conducted seriously.\n",

        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that \"git clone\" is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any issues, and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  for grading facilitation (e.g., testing or automation scripts).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject before starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends, and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review the submitted work together to identify\n  mistakes that should not be repeated in the future.\n",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n- Constructive feedback helps your peers improve. The well-being of \n  the community depends on a supportive approach.\n\n2. **Identify and Discuss Issues**\n- Work with the student or group to identify potential issues in their project.\n  Take the time to discuss and debate any problems you find.\n\n3. **Acknowledge Different Approaches**\n- Recognize that different students may have different interpretations of the\n  project’s instructions and requirements.\n- Keep an open mind and grade as honestly and fairly as possible.\n- The effectiveness of peer evaluation depends on serious and thoughtful assessment.\n\n4. **Handling Incorrect Exercises**\n- If you encounter an incorrect exercise, stop the assessment immediately.\n- Do not proceed to the next exercise if a previous one is incorrect.\n- Use the appropriate flags to report the issue and provide feedback to the student.\n",
        "disclaimer_md": "",
        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- Do not blindly trust any scripts. The tester could be wrong!\n\n- Check the makefile: no wildcard, no relink, or the final grade is 0.\n\n- Use make, then make --debug to be sure.\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \n  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n- Constructive feedback helps your peers improve. The well-being of \n  the community depends on a supportive approach.\n\n2. **Identify and Discuss Issues**\n- Work with the student or group to identify potential issues in their project.\n  Take the time to discuss and debate any problems you find.\n\n3. **Acknowledge Different Approaches**\n- Recognize that different students may have different interpretations of the\n  project’s instructions and requirements.\n- Keep an open mind and grade as honestly and fairly as possible.\n- The effectiveness of peer evaluation depends on serious and thoughtful assessment.\n\n4. **Handling Incorrect Exercises**\n- If you encounter an incorrect exercise, stop the assessment immediately.\n- Do not proceed to the next exercise if a previous one is incorrect.\n- Use the appropriate flags to report the issue and provide feedback to the student.\n",
        "disclaimer_md": "",
        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- Do not blindly trust any scripts. The tester could be wrong!\n\n- Check the makefile: no wildcard, no relink, or the final grade is 0.\n\n- Use make, then make --debug to be sure.\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \n  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

        "introduction_md": "When evaluating a project, please follow these essential rules to ensure fairness and\nmaintain a positive learning environment:\n\n1. **Maintain Respect and Constructiveness**\n- Be polite, courteous and respectful during the \n  evaluation process. The well-being of the community depends on it.\n- Constructive feedback helps your peers improve. The well-being of \n  the community depends on a supportive approach.\n\n2. **Identify and Discuss Issues**\n- Work with the student or group to identify potential issues in their project.\n  Take the time to discuss and debate any problems you find.\n\n3. **Acknowledge Different Approaches**\n- Recognize that different students may have different interpretations of the\n  project’s instructions and requirements.\n- Keep an open mind and grade as honestly and fairly as possible.\n- The effectiveness of peer evaluation depends on serious and thoughtful assessment.\n\n4. **Handling Incorrect Exercises**\n- If you encounter an incorrect exercise, stop the assessment immediately.\n- Do not proceed to the next exercise if a previous one is incorrect.\n- Use the appropriate flags to report the issue and provide feedback to the student.\n",
        "disclaimer_md": "",
        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- Do not blindly trust any scripts. The tester could be wrong!\n\n- Check the makefile: no wildcard, no relink, or the final grade is 0.\n\n- Use make, then make --debug to be sure.\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \n  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n- Constructive feedback helps your peers improve. The well-being of \n  the community depends on a supportive approach.\n\n2. **Identify and Discuss Issues**\n- Work with the student or group to identify potential issues in their project.\n  Take the time to discuss and debate any problems you find.\n\n3. **Acknowledge Different Approaches**\n- Recognize that different students may have different interpretations of the\n  project’s instructions and requirements.\n- Keep an open mind and grade as honestly and fairly as possible.\n- The effectiveness of peer evaluation depends on serious and thoughtful assessment.\n\n4. **Handling Incorrect Exercises**\n- If you encounter an incorrect exercise, stop the assessment immediately.\n- Do not proceed to the next exercise if a previous one is incorrect.\n- Use the appropriate flags to report the issue and provide feedback to the student.\n",
        "disclaimer_md": "",
        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- Do not blindly trust any scripts. The tester could be wrong!\n\n- Check the makefile: no wildcard, no relink, or the final grade is 0.\n\n- Use make, then make --debug to be sure.\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \n  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of \n  the community depends on a supportive approach.\n\n2. **Identify and Discuss Issues**\n- Work with the student or group to identify potential issues in their project.\n  Take the time to discuss and debate any problems you find.\n\n3. **Acknowledge Different Approaches**\n- Recognize that different students may have different interpretations of the\n  project’s instructions and requirements.\n- Keep an open mind and grade as honestly and fairly as possible.\n- The effectiveness of peer evaluation depends on serious and thoughtful assessment.\n\n4. **Handling Incorrect Exercises**\n- If you encounter an incorrect exercise, stop the assessment immediately.\n- Do not proceed to the next exercise if a previous one is incorrect.\n- Use the appropriate flags to report the issue and provide feedback to the student.\n",
        "disclaimer_md": "",
        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- Do not blindly trust any scripts. The tester could be wrong!\n\n- Check the makefile: no wildcard, no relink, or the final grade is 0.\n\n- Use make, then make --debug to be sure.\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \n  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n- Constructive feedback helps your peers improve. The well-being of \n  the community depends on a supportive approach.\n\n2. **Identify and Discuss Issues**\n- Work with the student or group to identify potential issues in their project.\n  Take the time to discuss and debate any problems you find.\n\n3. **Acknowledge Different Approaches**\n- Recognize that different students may have different interpretations of the\n  project’s instructions and requirements.\n- Keep an open mind and grade as honestly and fairly as possible.\n- The effectiveness of peer evaluation depends on serious and thoughtful assessment.\n\n4. **Handling Incorrect Exercises**\n- If you encounter an incorrect exercise, stop the assessment immediately.\n- Do not proceed to the next exercise if a previous one is incorrect.\n- Use the appropriate flags to report the issue and provide feedback to the student.\n",
        "disclaimer_md": "",
        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- Do not blindly trust any scripts. The tester could be wrong!\n\n- Check the makefile: no wildcard, no relink, or the final grade is 0.\n\n- Use make, then make --debug to be sure.\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \n  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n- Constructive feedback helps your peers improve. The well-being of \n  the community depends on a supportive approach.\n\n2. **Identify and Discuss Issues**\n- Work with the student or group to identify potential issues in their project.\n  Take the time to discuss and debate any problems you find.\n\n3. **Acknowledge Different Approaches**\n- Recognize that different students may have different interpretations of the\n  project’s instructions and requirements.\n- Keep an open mind and grade as honestly and fairly as possible.\n- The effectiveness of peer evaluation depends on serious and thoughtful assessment.\n\n4. **Handling Incorrect Exercises**\n- If you encounter an incorrect exercise, stop the assessment immediately.\n- Do not proceed to the next exercise if a previous one is incorrect.\n- Use the appropriate flags to report the issue and provide feedback to the student.\n",
        "disclaimer_md": "",
        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- Do not blindly trust any scripts. The tester could be wrong!\n\n- Check the makefile: no wildcard, no relink, or the final grade is 0.\n\n- Use make, then make --debug to be sure.\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \n  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n- Constructive feedback helps your peers improve. The well-being of \n  the community depends on a supportive approach.\n\n2. **Identify and Discuss Issues**\n- Work with the student or group to identify potential issues in their project.\n  Take the time to discuss and debate any problems you find.\n\n3. **Acknowledge Different Approaches**\n- Recognize that different students may have different interpretations of the\n  project’s instructions and requirements.\n- Keep an open mind and grade as honestly and fairly as possible.\n- The effectiveness of peer evaluation depends on serious and thoughtful assessment.\n\n4. **Handling Incorrect Exercises**\n- If you encounter an incorrect exercise, stop the assessment immediately.\n- Do not proceed to the next exercise if a previous one is incorrect.\n- Use the appropriate flags to report the issue and provide feedback to the student.\n",
        "disclaimer_md": "",
        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- Do not blindly trust any scripts. The tester could be wrong!\n\n- Check the makefile: no wildcard, no relink, or the final grade is 0.\n\n- Use make, then make --debug to be sure.\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \n  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

Git history can be better and I gave him some tips about that! He is doing a lot of side hustle working with a bit more different languages, that's the first project for him in the Curriculum, and it was quiet surprisedly for me to meet such a gem, I even remember my first days, haha! The code is clean as well and everything works as expected, maybe some errors can be found through other systems but that's not the case! Thanks!",

        "introduction_md": "When evaluating a project, please follow these essential rules to ensure fairness and\nmaintain a positive learning environment:\n\n1. **Maintain Respect and Constructiveness**\n- Be polite, courteous and respectful during the \n  evaluation process. The well-being of the community depends on it.\n- Constructive feedback helps your peers improve. The well-being of \n  the community depends on a supportive approach.\n\n2. **Identify and Discuss Issues**\n- Work with the student or group to identify potential issues in their project.\n  Take the time to discuss and debate any problems you find.\n\n3. **Acknowledge Different Approaches**\n- Recognize that different students may have different interpretations of the\n  project’s instructions and requirements.\n- Keep an open mind and grade as honestly and fairly as possible.\n- The effectiveness of peer evaluation depends on serious and thoughtful assessment.\n\n4. **Handling Incorrect Exercises**\n- If you encounter an incorrect exercise, stop the assessment immediately.\n- Do not proceed to the next exercise if a previous one is incorrect.\n- Use the appropriate flags to report the issue and provide feedback to the student.\n",
        "disclaimer_md": "",
        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- Do not blindly trust any scripts. The tester could be wrong!\n\n- Check the makefile: no wildcard, no relink, or the final grade is 0.\n\n- Use make, then make --debug to be sure.\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \n  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

It was interesting to see how a strategy works really good against some bots but has flaws against others. For example, your bot defeated the lvl6 bot, but lost against the lvl2 one.
