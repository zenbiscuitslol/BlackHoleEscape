Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. Pedagogy is effective only if peer evaluation is taken seriously.\n",

Additionally, ensure that 'git clone'\n  is executed in an empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, students are\n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was submitted, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. If memory leaks are detected, select\n  the appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n\n- Identify with the student or group whose work is evaluated the possible \n  dysfunctions in their project. Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. The pedagogy is useful only and only if the peer-evaluation is \n  done seriously.\n",

        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, student are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \n  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities.

Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty directory.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to deceive you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises, and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate grading, such as testing or automation scripts.\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you\n  must read the entire subject before starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, etc.\n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends, and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in the case of cheating. However, except in cases of cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review the submitted work together \n  to identify any mistakes that should not be repeated in the future.\n\n- You must also verify that there are no memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the program's execution ends.\n  You are allowed to use any of the tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence.

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n\n- Identify the possible dysfunctions in the project of the student or\n  group whose work is being evaluated. Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. Pedagogy is useful only if peer evaluation is done seriously.\n",

        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work submitted in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student or students. Ensure that \n  the project is the expected one. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty directory.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to deceive you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises, and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate grading, such as testing or automation scripts.\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you\n  must read the entire subject before starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, etc.\n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends, and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in the case of cheating. However, except in cases of cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review the submitted work together \n  to identify any mistakes that should not be repeated in the future.\n\n- You must also verify that there are no memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the program's execution ends.\n  You are allowed to use any of the tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n\n- Identify with the student or group whose work is evaluated the possible \n  dysfunctions in their project. Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. The pedagogy is useful only and only if the peer-evaluation is \n  done seriously.\n",

        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, student are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \n  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

So keep doing it like that, that's great work!\r\nAll in all it was a good one and I wish you good luck with future projects!",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n\n- Identify with the student or group whose work is evaluated the possible \n  dysfunctions in their project. Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. The pedagogy is useful only if the peer-evaluation is \n  conducted seriously.\n",
        "disclaimer_md": "",
        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Ensure that no malicious aliases were used to deceive you into\n  evaluating content that is not part of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends, and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in the case of cheating. However, except for cases of cheating,\n  students are strongly encouraged to review the submitted work together\n  to identify mistakes that should be avoided in the future.\n\n- During the defense, the program must not produce any segmentation faults,\n  unexpected crashes, or uncontrolled terminations; otherwise, the final grade\n  will be 0. Use the appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you need to edit a file, clearly explain the reason to the\n  evaluated student and ensure that both of you agree on the modification.\n\n- You must also ensure that there are no memory leaks. Any memory allocated on\n  the heap must be properly freed before the program terminates. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. Pedagogy is effective only if peer evaluation is \n  conducted seriously.\n",

Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that \"git clone\" is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n\n- Identify with the student or group whose work is evaluated the possible \n  dysfunctions in their project. Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. The pedagogy is useful only if the peer-evaluation is \n  conducted seriously.\n",
        "disclaimer_md": "",
        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Ensure that no malicious aliases were used to deceive you into\n  evaluating content that is not part of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends, and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in the case of cheating. However, except for cases of cheating,\n  students are strongly encouraged to review the submitted work together\n  to identify mistakes that should be avoided in the future.\n\n- During the defense, the program must not produce any segmentation faults,\n  unexpected crashes, or uncontrolled terminations; otherwise, the final grade\n  will be 0. Use the appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you need to edit a file, clearly explain the reason to the\n  evaluated student and ensure that both of you agree on the modification.\n\n- You must also ensure that there are no memory leaks. Any memory allocated on\n  the heap must be properly freed before the program terminates. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n\n- Identify with the student or group whose work is evaluated the possible \n  dysfunctions in their project. Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. The pedagogy is useful only if the peer-evaluation is \n  conducted seriously.\n",
        "disclaimer_md": "",
        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Ensure that no malicious aliases were used to deceive you into\n  evaluating content that is not part of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends, and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in the case of cheating. However, except for cases of cheating,\n  students are strongly encouraged to review the submitted work together\n  to identify mistakes that should be avoided in the future.\n\n- During the defense, the program must not produce any segmentation faults,\n  unexpected crashes, or uncontrolled terminations; otherwise, the final grade\n  will be 0. Use the appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you need to edit a file, clearly explain the reason to the\n  evaluated student and ensure that both of you agree on the modification.\n\n- You must also ensure that there are no memory leaks. Any memory allocated on\n  the heap must be properly freed before the program terminates. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n\n- Identify with the student or group whose work is evaluated the possible \n  dysfunctions in their project. Take the time to discuss and debate the \n  problems that may have been identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers \n  might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its \n  functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as \n  possible. The pedagogy is useful only if the peer-evaluation is \n  conducted seriously.\n",

        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Ensure that no malicious aliases were used to deceive you into\n  evaluating content that is not part of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends, and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in the case of cheating. However, except for cases of cheating,\n  students are strongly encouraged to review the submitted work together\n  to identify mistakes that should be avoided in the future.\n\n- During the defense, the program must not produce any segmentation faults,\n  unexpected crashes, or uncontrolled terminations; otherwise, the final grade\n  will be 0. Use the appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you need to edit a file, clearly explain the reason to the\n  evaluated student and ensure that both of you agree on the modification.\n\n- You must also ensure that there are no memory leaks. Any memory allocated on\n  the heap must be properly freed before the program terminates. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community depends on it.\n- Constructive feedback helps your peers improve. The well-being of \n  the community depends on a supportive approach.\n\n2. **Identify and Discuss Issues**\n- Work with the student or group to identify potential issues in their project.\n  Take the time to discuss and debate any problems you find.\n\n3. **Acknowledge Different Approaches**\n- Recognize that different students may have different interpretations of the\n  project’s instructions and requirements.\n- Keep an open mind and grade as honestly and fairly as possible.\n- The effectiveness of peer evaluation depends on serious and thoughtful assessment.\n\n4. **Handling Incorrect Exercises**\n- If you encounter an incorrect exercise, stop the assessment immediately.\n- Do not proceed to the next exercise if a previous one is incorrect.\n- Use the appropriate flags to report the issue and provide feedback to the student.\n",
        "disclaimer_md": "",
        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated \n  student or group.\n\n- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that \n  the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an \n  empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you and make you \n  evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used \n  to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).\n\n- Do not blindly trust any scripts. The tester could be wrong!\n\n- Check the makefile: no wildcard, no relink, or the final grade is 0.\n\n- Use make, then make --debug to be sure.\n\n- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have \n  to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.\n\n- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning \n  program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. \n  In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, \n  or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, students are \n  strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order \n  to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.\n\n- You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it \n  exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons \n  with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on \n  the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution. \n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, \n  such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the \n  appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community\n  depends on it.\n\n- Identify with the person (or the group) evaluated the eventual\n  dysfunctions of the work. Take the time to discuss\n  and debate the problems you have identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some difference in how your\n  peers might have understood the project's instructions and the\n  scope of its functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade\n  him/her as honestly as possible. The pedagogy is valid only and\n  only if peer-evaluation is conducted seriously.\n",

        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that is in the student or group's\n  GiT repository.\n\n- Double-check that the GiT repository belongs to the student\n  or the group. Ensure that the work is for the relevant project\n  and also check that \"git clone\" is used in an empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you\n  and make you evaluate something other than the content of the\n  official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises, carefully check that both the evaluating\n  and the evaluated students have reviewed the possible scripts used\n  to facilitate the grading.\n\n- If the evaluating student has not completed that particular\n  project yet, it is mandatory for this student to read the\n  entire subject prior to starting the defence.\n\n- Use the flags available on this scale to signal an empty repository,\n  non-functioning program, a norm error, cheating etc. In these cases,\n  the grading is over and the final grade is 0 (or -42 in case of\n  cheating). However, with the exception of cheating, you are\n  encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not\n  finished it) in order to identify any issues that may have caused\n  this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault,\n  no other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected\n  termination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the\n  appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it exists.\n  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons with the \n  evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- Check that there are only the requested files available in the git repository. \n  If not, the evaluation stop here.\n",

Take the time to discuss\n  and debate the problems you have identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some difference in how your\n  peers might have understood the project's instructions and the\n  scope of its functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade\n  him/her as honestly as possible. The pedagogy is valid only and\n  only if peer-evaluation is conducted seriously.\n",

Ensure that the work is for the relevant project\n  and also check that \"git clone\" is used in an empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you\n  and make you evaluate something other than the content of the\n  official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises, carefully check that both the evaluating\n  and the evaluated students have reviewed the possible scripts used\n  to facilitate the grading.\n\n- If the evaluating student has not completed that particular\n  project yet, it is mandatory for this student to read the\n  entire subject prior to starting the defence.\n\n- Use the flags available on this scale to signal an empty repository,\n  non-functioning program, a norm error, cheating etc. In these cases,\n  the grading is over and the final grade is 0 (or -42 in case of\n  cheating). However, with the exception of cheating, you are\n  encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not\n  finished it) in order to identify any issues that may have caused\n  this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault,\n  no other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected\n  termination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the\n  appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it exists.\n  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons with the \n  evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- Check that there are only the requested files available in the git repository. \n  If not, the evaluation stop here.\n",

The well-being of the community\n  depends on it.\n\n- Identify with the person (or the group) evaluated the eventual\n  dysfunctions of the work. Take the time to discuss\n  and debate the problems you have identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some difference in how your\n  peers might have understood the project's instructions and the\n  scope of its functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade\n  him/her as honestly as possible. The pedagogy is valid only and\n  only if peer-evaluation is conducted seriously.\n",

        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that is in the student or group's\n  GiT repository.\n\n- Double-check that the GiT repository belongs to the student\n  or the group. Ensure that the work is for the relevant project\n  and also check that \"git clone\" is used in an empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you\n  and make you evaluate something other than the content of the\n  official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises, carefully check that both the evaluating\n  and the evaluated students have reviewed the possible scripts used\n  to facilitate the grading.\n\n- If the evaluating student has not completed that particular\n  project yet, it is mandatory for this student to read the\n  entire subject prior to starting the defence.\n\n- Use the flags available on this scale to signal an empty repository,\n  non-functioning program, a norm error, cheating etc. In these cases,\n  the grading is over and the final grade is 0 (or -42 in case of\n  cheating). However, with the exception of cheating, you are\n  encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not\n  finished it) in order to identify any issues that may have caused\n  this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault,\n  no other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected\n  termination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the\n  appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it exists.\n  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons with the \n  evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- Check that there are only the requested files available in the git repository. \n  If not, the evaluation stop here.\n",

Take the time to discuss\n  and debate the problems you have identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some difference in how your\n  peers might have understood the project's instructions and the\n  scope of its functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade\n  him/her as honestly as possible. The pedagogy is valid only and\n  only if peer-evaluation is conducted seriously.\n",

        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that is in the student or group's\n  GiT repository.\n\n- Double-check that the GiT repository belongs to the student\n  or the group. Ensure that the work is for the relevant project\n  and also check that \"git clone\" is used in an empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you\n  and make you evaluate something other than the content of the\n  official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises, carefully check that both the evaluating\n  and the evaluated students have reviewed the possible scripts used\n  to facilitate the grading.\n\n- If the evaluating student has not completed that particular\n  project yet, it is mandatory for this student to read the\n  entire subject prior to starting the defence.\n\n- Use the flags available on this scale to signal an empty repository,\n  non-functioning program, a norm error, cheating etc. In these cases,\n  the grading is over and the final grade is 0 (or -42 in case of\n  cheating). However, with the exception of cheating, you are\n  encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not\n  finished it) in order to identify any issues that may have caused\n  this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault,\n  no other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected\n  termination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the\n  appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it exists.\n  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons with the \n  evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- Check that there are only the requested files available in the git repository. \n  If not, the evaluation stop here.\n",

Ensure that the work is for the relevant project\n  and also check that \"git clone\" is used in an empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you\n  and make you evaluate something other than the content of the\n  official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises, carefully check that both the evaluating\n  and the evaluated students have reviewed the possible scripts used\n  to facilitate the grading.\n\n- If the evaluating student has not completed that particular\n  project yet, it is mandatory for this student to read the\n  entire subject prior to starting the defence.\n\n- Use the flags available on this scale to signal an empty repository,\n  non-functioning program, a norm error, cheating etc. In these cases,\n  the grading is over and the final grade is 0 (or -42 in case of\n  cheating). However, with the exception of cheating, you are\n  encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not\n  finished it) in order to identify any issues that may have caused\n  this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault,\n  no other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected\n  termination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the\n  appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it exists.\n  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons with the \n  evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- Check that there are only the requested files available in the git repository. \n  If not, the evaluation stop here.\n",

The well-being of the community\n  depends on it.\n\n- Identify with the person (or the group) evaluated the eventual\n  dysfunctions of the work. Take the time to discuss\n  and debate the problems you have identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some difference in how your\n  peers might have understood the project's instructions and the\n  scope of its functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade\n  him/her as honestly as possible. The pedagogy is valid only and\n  only if peer-evaluation is conducted seriously.\n",

        "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that is in the student or group's\n  GiT repository.\n\n- Double-check that the GiT repository belongs to the student\n  or the group. Ensure that the work is for the relevant project\n  and also check that \"git clone\" is used in an empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you\n  and make you evaluate something other than the content of the\n  official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises, carefully check that both the evaluating\n  and the evaluated students have reviewed the possible scripts used\n  to facilitate the grading.\n\n- If the evaluating student has not completed that particular\n  project yet, it is mandatory for this student to read the\n  entire subject prior to starting the defence.\n\n- Use the flags available on this scale to signal an empty repository,\n  non-functioning program, a norm error, cheating etc. In these cases,\n  the grading is over and the final grade is 0 (or -42 in case of\n  cheating). However, with the exception of cheating, you are\n  encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not\n  finished it) in order to identify any issues that may have caused\n  this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault,\n  no other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected\n  termination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the\n  appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it exists.\n  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons with the \n  evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- Check that there are only the requested files available in the git repository. \n  If not, the evaluation stop here.\n",
